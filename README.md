Introduction
------------

This project is designed to parse PDF files and generate effective prompts for a Large Language Model (LLM). The script uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from the input PDF, and then applies a series of natural language processing (NLP) transformations to create prompts.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.8+
* PyPDF2 library (`pip install PyPDF2`)
* Argparse library (`pip install argparse`)

Usage
-----

1. Save this script as `pdf_prompt_generator.py`.
2. Run the script using the following command: `python pdf_prompt_generator.py <input_pdf_file>`
3. The script will generate prompts for each page in the input PDF and print them to the console.

Known Issues
------------

* This script assumes that the input PDF contains text that can be parsed by the PyPDF2 library.
* If the input PDF is corrupted or does not contain any readable text, the script may fail.
* The use of multiple processes to generate prompts simultaneously may lead to issues if the system resources are insufficient.

Code Explanation
-----------------

The code is organized into several functions:

1. `parse_answer_question`: takes a string input and extracts relevant Q&A pairs from it.
2. `generate_prompt`: generates effective prompts based on user-defined parameters.
3. `run_llm_model`: runs an LLM model with the generated prompt as input.
4. `parse_pdf`: parses a PDF file using PyPDF2 and extracts text from each page.

The main function uses argparse to parse command-line arguments, and then calls the `parse_pdf` function to extract text from the input PDF. The extracted text is then passed through the `generate_prompt` function to create effective prompts, which are finally generated by the `run_llm_model` function using an LLM model.
